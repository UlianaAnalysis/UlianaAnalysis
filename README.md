* Gain an immersive understanding of the practices and processes used by a junior or associate data analyst in their day-to-day job  
* Learn key analytical skills (data cleaning, analysis, & visualization) and tools (spreadsheets, SQL, Python, Tableau)
* Understand how to clean and organize data for analysis, and complete analysis and calculations using spreadsheets, SQL and Python  
* Learn how to visualize and present data findings in dashboards, presentations and commonly used visualization platforms
